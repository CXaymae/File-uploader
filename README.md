# File Uploader (AJAX, PHP, CSS)

This is a simple file uploader project implemented using AJAX, PHP, and CSS. The project allows users to select and upload files from their local system to the server.

## Features

- File selection: Users can select files using a file input field.
- Progress tracking: The progress of file upload is displayed with a progress bar, indicating the percentage of the file uploaded.
- File information: Uploaded files are displayed with their names and sizes.
- File validation: The PHP script handles server-side file validation and securely moves the uploaded files to a specified directory on the server.

## Technologies Used

- **AJAX**: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) is used to send HTTP requests to the server without refreshing the entire web page. It enables seamless and interactive file uploads.
- **PHP**: PHP is a server-side scripting language used to handle file uploads, perform server-side validation, and manage file storage on the server.
- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to style and enhance the appearance of the file uploader interface, providing a visually pleasing and user-friendly experience.
